I am a Staff Scientist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where I focus on cutting-edge skin microbiome and metabolomics research within the Epithelial Therapeutics Unit. My research leverages a systems biology approach to study the potential biomarkers and mechanisms underlying various diseases, with a particular emphasis on translating findings into potential therapeutic strategies.

My computational and experimental expertise includes:

#High-throughput sequencing data analysis: 
Proficient in 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics, using tools such as QIIME2, Mothur, and various bioinformatics pipelines for taxonomic profiling, diversity analysis, and functional prediction.

#Metabolomics data processing and analysis: 
Skilled in LC-MS and GC-MS data analysis, utilizing software like MetaboAnalyst, MZmine, and custom R scripts for peak detection, normalization, metabolite identification, and pathway analysis.

#Statistical and machine learning techniques: 
Experienced in integrating multi-omics data, identifying key biomarkers, and building predictive models of disease states, employing methods like Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and network analysis.

#Scripting and programming in R : 
Proficient in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization, with expertise in packages such as ggplot2, dplyr, and mixOmics.

#Experience with cloud computing platforms: 
Adept at handling large-scale datasets and leveraging cloud-based tools for data analysis and storage.

#Specifically, my current work explores:

The intricate interplay between the skin microbiome and metabolome in atopic dermatitis (eczema), seeking to understand how microbial dysbiosis and metabolic imbalances contribute to disease pathogenesis and severity.

Host-microbe interactions on the skin surface, investigating how specific microbial species and their metabolites interact with host immune responses and skin barrier function.

The impact of environmental exposures on skin health, including the effects of pollutants and other environmental factors on the skin microbiome and metabolome.

Building upon my extensive experience in microbiome and metabolomics research, I am dedicated to unraveling the complexities of skin biology and identifying novel targets for precision medicine. My previous research has spanned diverse areas, including gut microbiome studies at Nanyang Technological University, oral microbiome studies at The Ohio State University, and methanogen diversity analysis at Universit√© d'Auvergne and Palack√Ω University. This broad background equips me with a unique perspective to integrate multi-omics data and develop innovative approaches for understanding and treating skin diseases.

I am always open to collaborations and discussions on related topics. Please feel free to contact me.
